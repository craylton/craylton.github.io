    <p>Hi, I’m Simon — a senior full‑stack software developer with ~10 years in the trenches (C#.NET and friends). I care about clean, maintainable code, good practices, and helping teams level up. I also talk to rubber ducks when debugging. They’re great listeners.</p>
    <p>This site is my digital workbench: experiments, notes, and slightly unhinged side projects. You’ll find an RGB Game of Life that’s far too lively for a grid, a tiny Memory Game pair‑programmed with an AI, and the odd blog post on finance, philosophy, fitness, and why the economy is weird.</p>
    <p>If you’re browsing, start with <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> or dip into the <a href="blog.html">Blog</a>. If you came here to judge my font choices, I respect the hustle. Either way — glad you’re here.</p>
