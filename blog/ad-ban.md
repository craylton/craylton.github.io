## What if advertising was illegal?
21st April 2025

Imagine waking up tomorrow in a world with no advertising. No banner ads, no pop-ups, no billboards. No jingles, no influencers pausing mid-sentence to promote a teeth-whitening kit, no targeted Instagram stories trying to sell you a jacket you glanced at once.

TV and radio breaks? Gone. YouTube mid-rolls? Gone. Sponsored tweets and branded TikToks? All gone.

It sounds almost surreal — maybe even a little utopian. But what would that world actually look like?

This isn’t just a whimsical daydream. I’ve long been uncomfortable with the role advertising plays in our lives. I always recommend using ad blockers, and I avoid installing apps that rely on ads. Over time, I’ve found myself wondering: what if we just banned it altogether? The more I think about it, the more it seems not only feasible, but in some ways ideal.

Surprisingly, when I suggest this to other people, it's usually met with a lot of resistance.
- "What about the content creators? All your favourite influencers wouldn't be able to create entertainment anymore!"
- "Television basically runs on ads - banning ads would be basically banning television!"
- "Marketing is a huge industry, think about how many people would lose their jobs!"
- "Small businesses rely heavily on adverts. If they can't advertise themselves, they'd cease to exist!"
- "Social media would pretty much cease to exist! That would be a bad thing!"

...and various other concerns which I can't get my head around. But before I get into my own personal take on this scenario, I want to briefly list a few of the major changes we would see.

### What would actually change if we banned advertising?

1. The content economy would collapse — but mostly for the minority who depend on ads
    - Influencers, content creators, and streamers would lose their main income source. Many would need to retrain or switch industries. This is tough for them — although those who make a living from it represent only around 1% of the global population [{source 1}](https://linktr.ee/creator-report/static/Linktree-CreatorReport-2022-02f3aa05a27be6fecb3537b13d5ec9de.pdf) [{source 2}](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/adobe-future-of-creativity-study-165m-creators-joined-creator-economy-since-2020).
    - Platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch would either shrink dramatically or pivot to subscriptions-style business models, most likely losing mass appeal.
    - The advertising industry itself would collapse, with marketers and ad professionals needing to shift to other sectors. Similarly to content creators, this would affect a minority of people - around 2% of the global population [{source}](https://www.ama.org/marketing-industry-stats-and-information/) The good news? Many have transferable skills.
2. Social media and ad-driven platforms would fade, with mixed effects
    - Social media networks would struggle to survive without ad revenue, making it harder to stay in touch—but arguably freeing us from endless doomscrolling and toxic comparisons.
    - Research links heavy social media use to mental health issues, including anxiety and depression [{source}](https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/social-medias-impact-our-mental-health-and-tips-to-use-it-safely/2024/05).
3. Our consumption habits — and the planet—would benefit
    - People would buy less impulsively, making decisions based on actual need, quality, or word-of-mouth rather than ad campaigns.
    - Overconsumption would drop, cutting waste, pollution, and fast fashion's grip on our wallets and landfills.
    - Without ads cluttering our cities, websites, and feeds, we'd enjoy cleaner, less stressful environments—and fewer distractions designed to hijack our attention. Visual clutter increases cortisol, which leads to stress [{source}](https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/clutter-health-impact/845209).
    - Real-world models like Bhutan, where advertising is tightly regulated, suggest this shift could boost overall well-being—even if hard data is sparse.

So to summarise all of the above: some big companies would die out, and a minority of the population would need to transfer careers. Meanwhile, the overall mental health of the population would improve, and there would be less waste, leading to a healthier environment. People would likely find themselves with more savings due to being more picky about what they buy, although we'd certainly see a reduction in global growth to match.

Now I'll stop playing devil's advocate and give some of my actual opinions.

1. Advertising-based platforms — from television to TikTok — are, in my view, a net drain on people's well-being. Don't get me wrong, sometimes it's nice chill out by watching a show after a hard day. But there is a strong correlation between television consumption and low intelligence [{source}](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/08838158009363973?needAccess=true). These kinds of platforms encourage passive consumption, promote shallow thinking, and often leave people feeling worse. If banning ads meant the end of these platforms, I’d consider it a net gain.

2. The attention economy has driven many content creators toward clickbait, sensationalism, and low-quality material — often at the expense of meaningful content. Even educational and well-meaning creators can sometimes fall into this trap, spreading misinformation or veering into activism.

3. It may sound like a dramatic comparison, but consider how we treat harmful industries: when society collectively decides that something — like tobacco, hard drugs, or leaded petrol — does more harm than good, we regulate or ban it. Why should the marketing industry be immune to this kind of scrutiny?

4. It’s true that small businesses rely on advertising — but so do giant corporations, often far more aggressively. In fact, without paid ads, it's easy to see how the playing field might actually level somewhat, forcing companies to rely on product quality and word of mouth rather than sheer spending power.

I'll gladly admit there are situations where advertising can do genuine good. Sometimes the products being advertised are genuinely high quality and would improve lives. But filtering these good cases out from the bad is practically impossible. Plus, undeniably, a lot of our economy is reliant directly or indirectly on advertising, so as already mentioned, economic growth would take a big hit. For a lot of people, it would feel like a step backwards as they transition to more basic lifestyles.

And perhaps due to these benefits and more, a more realistic approach might be to heavily restrict/regulate/tax ads rather than outright ban them. But the overall gist of my argument is that less ads = happier population. And I think that's more important than economic growth, capitalism be damned.
