## What if advertising was illegal?
21st April 2025

Imagine waking up tomorrow in a world with no advertising. No banner ads, no pop-ups, no billboards. No jingles, no influencers pausing mid-sentence to promote a teeth-whitening kit, no targeted Instagram stories trying to sell you a jacket you glanced at once.

TV and radio breaks? Gone. YouTube mid-rolls? Gone. Sponsored tweets and branded TikToks? All gone.

It sounds almost surreal - maybe even a little utopian. But what would that world actually look like?

I’ve long been uncomfortable with the role advertising plays in our lives. I often recommend people use ad blockers, and I avoid installing apps that rely on ads. Over time, I’ve found myself wondering: what if we just banned ads altogether? The more I think about it, the more ideal it seems.

Surprisingly, when I suggest this to other people, it's usually met with a lot of resistance.
- "What about the content creators? All your favourite influencers wouldn't be able to create entertainment anymore!"
- "Television basically runs on ads - banning ads would be basically banning television!"
- "Marketing is a huge industry, think about how many people would lose their jobs!"
- "Small businesses rely heavily on adverts. If they can't advertise themselves, they'd cease to exist!"
- "Social media would pretty much cease to exist! That would be a bad thing!"

...and various other concerns which I can't quite get my head around. But before I get into my own personal take on this scenario, I want to briefly list a few of the major changes we would see.

### What would actually change if we banned advertising?

1. The content economy would collapse - but mostly for the minority who depend on ads
    - Influencers, content creators, and streamers would lose their main income source. Many would need to retrain or switch industries. This is tough for them - although those who make a living from it represent only around 1% of the global population [{source 1}](https://linktr.ee/creator-report/static/Linktree-CreatorReport-2022-02f3aa05a27be6fecb3537b13d5ec9de.pdf) [{source 2}](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/adobe-future-of-creativity-study-165m-creators-joined-creator-economy-since-2020).
    - Platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch would either shrink dramatically or pivot to subscriptions-style business models, most likely losing mass appeal.
    - The advertising industry itself would collapse, with marketers and ad professionals needing to shift to other sectors. Similarly to content creators, this would affect a minority of people - around 2% of the global population [{source}](https://www.ama.org/marketing-industry-stats-and-information/) The good news? Many have transferable skills.
2. Social media and ad-driven platforms would fade, with mixed effects
    - Social media networks would struggle to survive without ad revenue, making it harder to stay in touch - but arguably freeing us from endless doomscrolling and toxic comparisons.
    - Research links heavy social media use to mental health issues, including anxiety and depression [{source}](https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/social-medias-impact-our-mental-health-and-tips-to-use-it-safely/2024/05).
3. Our consumption habits - and the planet - would benefit
    - People would buy less impulsively, making decisions based on actual need, quality, or word-of-mouth rather than ad campaigns.
    - Overconsumption would drop, cutting waste, pollution, and fast fashion's grip on our wallets and landfills.
    - Without ads cluttering our cities, websites, and feeds, we'd enjoy cleaner, less stressful environments - and fewer distractions designed to hijack our attention. Visual clutter increases cortisol, which leads to stress [{source}](https://www.stylist.co.uk/fitness-health/wellbeing/clutter-health-impact/845209).
    - Real-world models like Bhutan, where advertising is tightly regulated, suggest this shift could boost overall well-being - even if hard data is sparse.

So to summarise all of the above: some big companies would die out, and a minority of the population would need to transfer careers. Meanwhile, the overall mental health of the population would improve, and there would be less waste, leading to a healthier environment. People would likely find themselves with more savings due to being more picky about what they buy, although we'd certainly see a reduction in global growth to match.

### What I think the outcomes of these changes will be

We've looked above at the big-picture shifts. Yes, we would lose some important parts of our lives, and many people would be negatively affected. But I still believe this would be worth it for the majority of the population - and here's why:

1. Advertising-based platforms - from television to TikTok - are, in my view, a net drain on people's well-being. Don't get me wrong, sometimes it's nice chill out by watching a show after a hard day. But there is a strong correlation between television consumption and low intelligence [{source}](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/08838158009363973?needAccess=true). These kinds of platforms encourage passive consumption, promote shallow thinking, and often leave people feeling worse. If banning ads meant the end of these platforms, I’d consider it a net gain.

2. The attention economy has driven many content creators toward clickbait, sensationalism, and low-quality material - often at the expense of meaningful content. Even educational and well-meaning creators can sometimes fall into this trap, spreading misinformation or veering into activism. Sometimes this kind of content can teach you something useful; sometimes you'll laugh out loud at a hilarious cat video; but it can be very difficult to distinguish valuable content from useless.

3. It may sound like a dramatic comparison, but consider how we treat harmful industries: when society collectively decides that something - like tobacco, hard drugs, or leaded petrol - does more harm than good, we regulate or ban it. Why should the marketing industry be immune to this kind of scrutiny?

4. It’s true that small businesses rely on advertising - but so do giant corporations, often far more aggressively. In fact, without paid ads, it's easy to see how the playing field might actually level somewhat, forcing companies to rely on product quality and word of mouth rather than sheer spending power.

I’ll gladly admit there are situations where advertising does genuine good. Some products really can improve lives, and ads help get the word out. But separating the good from the bad is almost impossible at scale. And let’s face it - much of our economy is tangled up with advertising, so dialing it down would mean slower economic growth and big adjustments for many. For some, that might feel like a step backwards as we relearn to live with less.

Maybe an outright ban isn’t the answer. Maybe the smarter path is to heavily regulate, restrict, or tax ads until they’re the exception, not the norm. But the bottom line is simple: fewer ads would mean a happier, healthier population. Less clutter. Less stress. Fewer distractions fighting for our attention. The economy might grumble - capitalism be damned - but I think most of us would breathe a little easier.
