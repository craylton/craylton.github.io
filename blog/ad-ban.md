## What if advertising was illegal?
21st April 2025

Imagine waking up tomorrow in a world with no advertising. No banner ads, no pop-ups, no billboards. No jingles, no influencers pausing mid-sentence to promote a teeth-whitening kit, no targeted Instagram stories trying to sell you a jacket you glanced at once.

TV and radio breaks? Gone. YouTube mid-rolls? Gone. Sponsored tweets and branded TikToks? All gone.

It sounds almost surreal — maybe even a little utopian. But what would that world actually look like?

This isn’t just a whimsical daydream. I’ve long been uncomfortable with the role advertising plays in our lives. I always recommend using ad blockers, and I avoid installing apps that rely on ads to function. Over time, I’ve found myself wondering: what if we just banned it altogether? The more I think about it, the more it seems not only feasible, but ideal.

Surprisingly, when I suggest it to other people, it's usually met with a lot of resistance.
- "What about the content creators? All your favourite influencers wouldn't be able to create entertainment any more!"
- "Television basically runs on ads - banning ads would be basically banning television!"
- "Marketing is a huge industry, think about how many people would lose their jobs!"
- "Small businesses rely heavily on adverts. If they can't advertise themselves, they'd cease to exist!"
- "Social media would pretty much cease to exist! That would be a bad thing!"

...and various other concerns which I can't get my head around. But before I get into my own personal take on this scenario, I want to briefly list a few of the major changes we would see.

1. Yes, content creators, influencers, tiktokers and youtubers would largely disappear.
    - These people would need to retrain into other jobs which don't rely on bombarding people with adverts.
    - This is obviously a bad thing for the content creators. But a quick search online suggests they only make up about 3% of the population. **(TODO reference source)** What about the other 97%?
2. The platforms that those content creators existed on, like Youtube, Twitch and so on, would also mostly disappear.
    - Those that don't disappear would have to switch to different business models such as subscription models, and would be much less popular.
    - Again, this is clearly a bad thing for the people working at those companies, and again, that represents the vast minority of people.
3. Social media would also be amongst the industries that disappear.
    - This would make it trickier to stay in touch with people.
    - At the same time, social media leads to mental health issues, decreased productivity, and negative social comparisons [{link}](https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/social-medias-impact-our-mental-health-and-tips-to-use-it-safely/2024/05), so a lot of problems would be solved by this move.
4. The advertising industry would collapse, and everyone working in the sector would have to move on to another job.
    - Similarly to the content creators, these people would need to find a job which doesn't rely on shoving ads in people's faces.
    - In fact this is a smaller problem than for content creators, as there are fewer people directly working in marketing compared to content creators **(TODO reference source)**, plus typically these people have transferrable skills already.
5. People would be forced to think more about what they're buying.
    - People's buying habits would be more driven by their actual desires and word-of-mouth, rather than people simply being told what to buy.
    - As people tend to buy more of what they need rather than what they want, simple and high quality products would become more prevalent.
6. There would be less waste and less pollution.
    - Advertising causes overconsumption - people tend to buy a lot of things they don't need and then throw them away.
    - 'Fast fashion' would become a thing of the past - people would buy clothes less often, but of higher quality, leading to less waste.
7. The visual world - online and offline - would be much more bearable.
    - Even those working in advertising would have to agree that the world would be a better looking place without billboards on city streets, banner ads/popups on websites, and so on, all of which were designed to be as distracting and eye-catching as possible.
    - This reduced visual clutter would create less stress for the population **(TODO reference source)**, and wouldn't fill our minds with nonsensical slogans and annoying characters.

So to summarise all of the above: some big companies would die out, and a minority of the population would need to transfer careers. Meanwhile, the overall mental health of the population would improve, and there would be less waste, leading to a healthier environment. People would likely find themselves with more savings due to being more picky about what they buy, although we'd certainly see a reduction in global growth to match.

Now for some of my opinions.

First of all, generally speaking, services that rely on advertising are a net drain on people's wellbeing. Television makes people dumber (**TODO find a source**), and losing television would make people smarter and give their lives more meaning. This goes for streaming services, TikTok, anything that causes people to just sit there staring at a screen.

Content creators, with their clickbait thumbnails and ALL-CAPS VIDEO TITLES are simply vile. I'm yet to find anyone who thinks these kind of videos provide any value whatsoever to the viewer. And even educational content creators are often found to be spreading fake news (whether intentionally or not) and pushing their own political agendas.

If you imagine a world where it was legal to deal and take drugs, and then imagine someone coming up with the idea to make it illegal - would you argue in favour of the drugs trade? Would you say: "What about the poor drug dealers? It's a huge industry, think how many people you'd be putting out of work!"? Obviously the drug trade makes the world a worse place, and assuming you aren't an addict, you'd probably be happy to see its prohibition.

The way I see it, based on the above, the marketing industry makes the world a worse place too, and has very few benefits. So why treat it like it needs respect and care, while the drugs industry should very obviously be outlawed? I know it's a bit of an extreme analogy, but you at least need a consistent viewpoint.

People often argue that small businesses would never be able to take off, since they rely on advertising. I never really got this argument, since big businesses rely on adverts too. In fact, surely big businesses rely on ads even more than small businesses?

Overall, the general gist of my argument is that less ads = happier population. And I think that's more important than economic growth, capitalism be damned.

One final point - Bhutan has very restrictive rules on advertising, so we can look to this as a case study. While I can't find any specific studies on the outcomes, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that there are many measurable local benefits in terms of quality of life.
