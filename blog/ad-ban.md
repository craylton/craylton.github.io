## What if advertising was illegal?
21st April 2025

Imagine waking up tomorrow in a world with no advertising. No banner ads, no pop-ups, no billboards. No jingles, no influencers pausing mid-sentence to promote a teeth-whitening kit, no targeted Instagram stories trying to sell you a jacket you glanced at once.

TV and radio breaks? Gone. YouTube mid-rolls? Gone. Sponsored tweets and branded TikToks? All gone.

It sounds almost surreal — maybe even a little utopian. But what would that world actually look like?

This isn’t just a whimsical daydream. I’ve long been uncomfortable with the role advertising plays in our lives. I always recommend using ad blockers, and I avoid installing apps that rely on ads to function. Over time, I’ve found myself wondering: what if we just banned it altogether? The more I think about it, the more it seems not only feasible, but ideal.

Surprisingly, when I suggest it to other people, it's usually met with a lot of resistance.
- "What about the content creators? All your favourite influencers wouldn't be able to create entertainment any more!"
- "Television basically runs on ads - banning ads would be basically banning television!"
- "Marketing is a huge industry, think about how many people would lose their jobs!"
- "Small businesses rely heavily on adverts. If they can't advertise themselves, they'd cease to exist!"
- "Social media would pretty much cease to exist! That would be a bad thing!"

...and various other concerns which I can't get my head around. But before I get into my own personal take on this scenario, I want to briefly list a few of the major changes we would see.

1. Yes, content creators, influencers, tiktokers and youtubers would largely disappear.
    - These people would need to retrain into other jobs which don't rely on bombarding people with adverts.
    - This is obviously a bad thing for the content creators. But a quick search online suggests they only make up about 3% of the population. **(TODO reference source)** What about the other 97%?
2. The platforms that those content creators existed on, like Youtube, Twitch and so on, would also mostly disappear.
    - Those that don't disappear would have to switch to different business models such as subscription models, and would be much less popular.
    - Again, this is clearly a bad thing for the people working at those companies, and again, that represents the vast minority of people.
3. Social media would also be amongst the industries that disappear.
    - This would make it trickier to stay in touch with people.
    - At the same time, social media leads to mental health issues, decreased productivity, and negative social comparisons [{link}](https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/social-medias-impact-our-mental-health-and-tips-to-use-it-safely/2024/05), so a lot of problems would be solved by this move.
4. The advertising industry would collapse, and everyone working in the sector would have to move on to another job.
    - Similarly to the content creators, these people would need to find a job which doesn't rely on shoving ads in people's faces.
    - In fact this is a smaller problem than for content creators, as there are fewer people directly working in marketing compared to content creators **(TODO reference source)**, plus typically these people have transferrable skills already.
5. People would be forced to think more about what they're buying.
    - People's buying habits would be more driven by their actual desires and word-of-mouth, rather than people simply being told what to buy.
    - As people tend to buy more of what they need rather than what they want, simple and high quality products would become more prevalent.
6. There would be less waste and less pollution.
    - Advertising causes overconsumption - people tend to buy a lot of things they don't need and then throw them away.
    - 'Fast fashion' would become a thing of the past - people would buy clothes less often, but of higher quality, leading to less waste.
7. The visual world - online and offline - would be much more bearable.
    - Even those working in advertising would have to agree that the world would be a better looking place without billboards on city streets, banner ads/popups on websites, and so on, all of which were designed to be as distracting and eye-catching as possible.
    - This reduced visual clutter would create less stress for the population **(TODO reference source)**, and wouldn't fill our minds with nonsensical slogans and annoying characters.
8. Real world use cases
    - Bhutan has very restrictive rules on advertising, where advertising dangerous products is extremely difficult. While I can't find any specific studies on the outcomes, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that there are many measurable local benefits in terms of quality of life.

So to summarise all of the above: some big companies would die out, and a minority of the population would need to transfer careers. Meanwhile, the overall mental health of the population would improve, and there would be less waste, leading to a healthier environment. People would likely find themselves with more savings due to being more picky about what they buy, although we'd certainly see a reduction in global growth to match.

Now I'll stop playing devil's advocate and give some of my actual opinions.

1. Advertising-based platforms — from television to TikTok — are, in my view, a net drain on people's well-being (**TODO find a source**). They encourage passive consumption, promote shallow thinking, and often leave people feeling worse than before. If banning ads meant the end of these platforms, I’d consider it a net gain.

2. The attention economy has driven many content creators toward clickbait, sensationalism, and low-quality material — often at the expense of meaningful content. Even educational creators can sometimes fall into this trap, spreading misinformation or veering into activism.

3. It may sound like a dramatic comparison, but consider how we treat harmful industries: when society collectively decides that something — like tobacco, hard drugs, or leaded petrol — does more harm than good, we regulate or ban it. Why should the marketing industry be immune to this kind of scrutiny?

4. It’s true that small businesses rely on advertising — but so do giant corporations, often far more aggressively. In fact, without paid ads, it's easy to see how the playing field might actually level somewhat, forcing companies to rely on product quality and word of mouth rather than sheer spending power.

I'll gladly admit there are situations where advertising can do genuine good. Sometimes the products being advertised are genuinely high quality and would improve lives. But filtering these good cases out from the bad is practically impossible. Plus, undeniably, a lot of our economy is reliant directly or indirectly on advertising, so as already mentioned, economic growth would take a big hit. For a lot of people, it would feel like a step backwards as they transition to more basic lifestyles.

And perhaps due to these benefits and more, a more realistic approach might be to heavily restrict/regulate/tax ads rather than outright ban them. But the overall gist of my argument is that less ads = happier population. And I think that's more important than economic growth, capitalism be damned.
