## What if advertising was illegal?
21st April 2025

Here's a thought experiment: advertising is globally banned. How would the world change?

To be clear, I'm quite strongly against advertising. I always recommend that people use ad blockers online, and I don't install apps that contain ads. So this concept is something I think about quite a bit, and the more I think about it, the more I like the idea. However when I suggest it to other people, it's usually met with a lot of resistance.
- "What about the content creators? All your favourite influencers wouldn't be able to create entertainment any more!"
- "Television basically runs on ads - banning ads would be basically banning television!"
- "Marketing is a huge industry, think about how many people would lose their jobs!"
- "Small businesses rely heavily on adverts. If they can't advertise themselves, they'd cease to exist!"
- "Social media would pretty much cease to exist! That would be a bad thing!"

...and various other concerns which frankly I find bizarre. But before I get into my own personal take on this scenario, I want to briefly list a few of the major changes we would see.

1. Yes, content creators, influencers, tiktokers and youtubers would largely disappear.
    - These people would need to retrain into other jobs, something where their income no longer relies on bombarding people with adverts.
    - This is obviously a bad thing for those poor innocent content creators. But a quick search online suggests they only make up about 3% of the population. **(TODO reference source)** What about the other 97% of us?
2. The platforms that those content creators existed on, like Youtube, Twitch and so on, would also mostly disappear.
    - Those that don't disappear would have to switch to subscription-style business models, and would be much less popular.
    - Again, this is clearly a bad thing for the people working at those companies, but again that represents the vast minority of people.
3. Social media would also be amongst the industries that disappear.
    - This would make it trickier to stay in touch with people.
    - At the same time, social media leads to mental health issues, decreased productivity, and negative social comparisons [{link}](https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/social-medias-impact-our-mental-health-and-tips-to-use-it-safely/2024/05), so a lot of problems would be solved by this move.
4. The advertising industry would collapse, and everyone working in the sector would have to move on to another job.
    - Similarly to the content creators, these people would need to find a job which doesn't rely on shoving ads in people's faces.
    - In fact this is a smaller problem than for content creators, as there are fewer people directly working in marketing compared to content creators **(TODO reference source)**, plus typically these people have transferrable skills already.
5. People would be forced to think more about what they're buying.
    - People's buying habits would be more driven by their actual desires and word-of-mouth, rather than people simply being told what to buy.
    - As people tend to buy more of what they need rather than what they want, simple and high quality products would become more prevalent.
6. There would be less waste and less pollution.
    - Advertising causes overconsumption - people tend to buy a lot of things they don't need and then throw them away.
    - 'Fast fashion' would become a thing of the past - people would buy clothes less often, but of higher quality, leading to less waste.
7. The visual world - online and offline - would be much more bearable.
    - Even those working in advertising would have to agree that the world would be a better looking place without billboards on city streets, banner ads/popups on websites, and so on, all of which were designed to be as distracting and eye-catching as possible.
    - This reduced visual clutter would create less stress for the population **(TODO reference source)**, and wouldn't fill our minds with nonsensical slogans and annoying characters.

So to summarise all of the above: some big companies would die out, and a minority of the population would need to transfer careers. Meanwhile, the overall mental health of the population would improve, and there would be less waste, leading to a healthier environment. People would likely find themselves with more savings due to being more picky about what they buy, although we'd probably see a reduction in global growth to match.

Quantifying the pros and cons is difficult, and probably requires a bit of gazing into a crystal ball. But I'd estimate

    How badly affected will they be? Can they get over it?
    Big businesses would suffer just as much as small ones
    People losing their jobs can just get other jobs
    The things that cease to exist are bad things anyway
