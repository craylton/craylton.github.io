## Coming Soon: The economy today is weird
25th September 2025

Let me start off by saying: I'm not an economist. I've not had to deal with major economic events like recessions before. I'm just a regular guy with a 9-5 job creating software, with a mild interest in money. But the state of the economy right now is very weird, and I just wanted to put my thoughts on a digital page.

Here's a hypotheitcal situation: you have some spare cash laying around, let's say about £100,000. What do you do with it? You have a few main options to consider. 

### Consumption

Starting with the most tempting, you could spend it. Get yourself a new car, upsize your home, go on a nice holiday, all the good stuff. Obviously these things are nice, but not the most sensible way to use your cash. If you spend £1,500 on a 7-day holiday in Iceland, you'll likely have a great time and get some lovely memories, but you'll clearly lose the entire £1,500. That's a -100% ROI. Which is generally considered quite a bad investment. The same logic applies for other types of consumption. Even upsizing the home you live in still isn't a great investment, since houses are expensive to maintain, don't generate income, and appreciate in value very slowly.(todo: add link)

So sure, you'll probably want to spend a bit of your money, the general recommendation is around 10% (todo:source), but you probably want to hold onto most of it. I might do another blog post at some point going into more detail on this. But let's look at some other things you could do with that money.

### Stocks

So alternatively you could invest in stocks. This is generally the advice you'll get from finance bros and finfluencers. Historically, stocks perform very well on average, and they're extremely low effort (especially if you invest in an index tracker). The S&P500 returns 9% (? todo: provide source) ROI on average. However, right now is an interesting time to be putting money into stocks, for a few reasons.

The elephant in the room here is the 'AI bubble'. Companies have invested colossal amounts (todo: how much?) into AI in the past couple of years, and stock prices have soared as a result. Now, regardless of how useful and cool AI is, the companies providing the AI are currently making a loss(todo: source!). An often-cited paper by MIT (todo) showed that even the companies adopting AI into their own workflows aren't seeing enough of a boost to justify the costs. Yet despite the lack of profits, stock prices continue to increase. Quite frankly, it's difficult to see this situation ending well for investors, at least in the short term.

But there are other problems in the stock market which don't get talked about as much. One of these problems is private equity. In a nutshell, private equity companies specialise in buying companies which aren't doing so well, make a few managerial changes to make the company look good, and then they sell the company on at a profit. However, they tend to buy the companies using debt, they use debt to make the refurbishments, and then often the company is bought by another PE firm using debt of its own. Basically the whole ecosystem is a complicated mess of debt buying debt. This could be described as a smaller-scale, more isolated version of what happened in the 2008 global financial crisis. It's a ticking time bomb and nobody knows when it'll go off.(todo: provide a link that describes this better)

Another thing people don't talk about so much is what I call 'crypto-boosting'. This is an effect where a stock's share price increases simply because it invests into cryptocurrency. The clearest example of this is Strategy (formally MicroStrategy) which fairly consistently trades at a net loss. However, since they started buying and holding a reserve of bitcoin, their share price has risen from about $12 to around $300. To be clear, they're still making a loss! And plenty of other companies have followed suit (todo: provide list). The reason why this happens is because investing in crypto is still a bit tricky, so these companies are seen as 'crypto proxies' - investing in one is kind of like investing in crypto. But here's the horrible feedback loop - and feedback loops in the economy are usually something to be extremely wary of - buying crypto attracts investment, and the investment is used to buy more crypto, and the loop continues, leading to crazy valuations. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to decide what happens when large amounts of money are pumped into companies that are making a loss and have no plan to change course. (todo:diagram of feedback loop) (todo: link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inI0SC3Zj4A)

I've just listed three reasons why the stock market is getting ready to explode at any moment. But here's the thing: it hasn't exploded yet. People were saying the AI bubble was getting ready to pop literally a year ago, and yet here we are, still pushing record highs. So what's going on? And the question I really don't know the answer to: where's all the money coming from? The majority of these investments are coming from within companies themselves (todo: source). The magnificent seven are doing enormous share buybacks, which only pushes their own share prices higher, but where are they getting the money from to do these buybacks given that they've just spent billions on a loss-generating tech? This is where my knowledge breaks down, and all I can do is throw my hands up and say it just looks really bad but I don't know why.

So anyway, we were talking about what to do with our £100,000. Since stocks don't look particularly safe, let's look at other asset classes.

### Crypto

Crypto is ridiculously difficult to analyse, and as a result this section might come across as a bit unhinged. A bitcoin has no inherent value. If you have a bitcoin, the only thing that you can really do with it is sell it. It helps people in no other (legal) way - even if you're lucky enough to find something you can buy with bitcoin, you'll be hit with ludicrous transaction fees. So in that respect, pretty much all cryptocurrency has a value of £0.

But clearly that isn't true - one Bitcoin is comfortably worth above $110,000 at the moment. Crypto is difficult to tax, and is great for buying things on the black market, money laundering etc, which is actually a crazy useful property for a lot of people in our current surveillance state.(todo: find some evidence) Governments will recognise this, and will probably be reluctant and careful with crypto - as ultimately it enables crime/corruption and potentially reduces tax intake - so in the future you might expect crypto to become gradually more centralised and regulated, which would defeat the one and only benefit crypto currently has.

And yes, I hear you telling me how Trump is pushing *for* crypto rather than against it like he used to (todo: link). In reality, crytocurrency is actually closely correlated with the stock market (likely due to the fact that selling it is the most useful thing you can legally do with it, so it's pretty much only a financial asset and nothing else). And Trump, a man who always has one eye on the stock market, has found that controlling crypto is a great way of indirectly controlling the stock market. Handy huh?
(todo: condense the past 2 paragraphs)

To summarise, many of the problems we looked at in the stock market apply to crypto too since they are closely linked. The crypto world is constantly rife with scams and scandals, and crypto prices swing wildly for often no reason at all. You'd probably be a bit nervous putting your £100,000 in here. Let's keep looking.

### Bonds

Bonds have typically been considered the 'safe' choice for investors. Governments are so trustworthy that when you buy bonds from them, you just *know* they'll pay out in full. Except even that's starting to change. The international powerhouse, the USA, is now only a mere AA+ credit rating downgraded from its AAA. And to put that in perspective since AA+ still sounds pretty good, France has an AA- rating and is talking about needing an IMF bailout.

Take a look at the list of countries by credit rating and see how many have a 'Positive' outlook. (todo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_credit_rating) Spoiler: there are 5 at the time of writing, and 10 are negative.

So bonds, which have a fairly low ROI anyway, aren't looking as safe as they once did. Let's keep looking!

### Precious metals

Gold just keeps going up. The price of gold has doubled in the past 2 years, and every time you think it can't possibly go up any more, it goes up even more. The fact is, everyone is expecting a stock market bust at some point, and at the same time everyone's expecting inflation to increase. Gold is historically a hedge against inflation, but is also great for diversifying, which is important when you're expecting a crash of some kind. Hence, people (and institutions) just keep on buying gold and other precious metals.

But there is a problem here too. See, when people buy gold, they usually don't buy gold bars. They buy paper gold, like a gold ETF, or gold options/futures. And it's no secret that the amount of gold claimed on paper is far higher than the amount of actual gold in existence. So when you buy gold via an ETF, what are you actually buying if all the real gold in the world is already owned by someone else? Again this is where my knowledge breaks down - I'm not sure what the implications of this are. But again, all I can really say about this is that gold seems not only very expensive, but also very precarious.

### Property

We're running out of places to put our £100,000 now. So let's look at a classic - buying a rental property. Historically this has been a very lucrative investment. But now, in the UK at least, the government has been trying its very hardest to make things difficult for landlords (todo: link to list of reasons). And regular people are struggling more and more to get onto the housing ladder.

Now there's an absolute ton of expert analysis on this topic already(todo: links), so I won't add to the pile. Although maybe I'll do a separate blog post on that one day. But ultimately we're in a position where people are buying their first home later in life, getting long-term mortgages that last beyond their retirement age, and then spending the rest of their lives struggling to pay for it. I don't see this as sustainable. And in my opinion, the "just build more houses" approach is exactly what China did, and look where it got them (todo: link). So I'm expecting some kind of major shake-up in the property market in the future.

### So what do we do?

Okay, I don't know the answer to this. Just about everywhere you look in the financial world, something is right on the verge of collapsing. You could diversify and put a bit of money into each of these places, but you're still putting yourself in harms way. Alternatively, stuffing it into a pillowcase doesn't sound like a terrible idea I guess. Buy a racehorse maybe?

By the way, the point of this article isn't actually to spread fear. The fact that things _havent_ collapsed suggests that actually there is actually enough duct tape to hold things together - at least for now. And clearly there is a fair bit about the markets that goes over my head, so I've probably misunderstood some of this. But I just wanted to get my jumbled thoughts onto a page really.
